ENERGY DRINK MARKET ANALYSIS FOR CODEX
PROBLEM STATEMENT:



CodeX is a German Beverage Company aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in Tier1 and Tier2 cities of India, and recently a survey was conducted in all those cities.

As a Data Analyst for CodeX, my task was to analyze the survey results and provide meaningful insights to CodeX to improve its stand in the Indian market.

TOOLS USED:



1. MS-Excel - To clean and format the data.

2. SQL - Although not directly used, the concept of joins proved beneficial to complete the task.

3. Canva - For Creating the slides and video presentation



Approach:

The Google data analytics course helped me lay the foundation for a roadmap to solve such problems.

1. Ask - Defining the problem and confirming the stakeholders' expectations. (The primary and secondary insights)

2. Prepare - Collecting and storing data for analysis.(already provided by the team)

3. Process - Cleaning and transforming the data.(Done using Excel and Tableau's in-built function)

4. Analyze - Using data analysis tools to draw conclusions. (Used Tableau and pivot feature of MS-Excel)

5. Share - Interpret and communicate results to others to make data-driven decisions. (Tableau's visualisation and Canva's presentation capabilities came to help here)

6. Act - Put your insights to work in order to solve the original problem. (The CodeX management is expected to act on recommended strategies hereon)
